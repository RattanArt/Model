## Euler's Identity

In mathematics, **Euler's identity** is the equality
$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. $$

### Explanation

Euler's identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex
analysis, which states that for any real number $ x $,
$$ e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x. $$

    B--x A: I am OK thanks!
    B-x J: I am fine thanks!
    Note right of J: B thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    B-->A: Checking with J...
